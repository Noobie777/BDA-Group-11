## Communication Plan
We plan on communicating via email, text and Discord. We will schedule Zoom meetings every Sunday to share ideas.

## Data Resource
The data that we plan to work with is the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) Trip Record Data.
The dataset contains data of trips taken by taxis and for-hire vehicles in New York City.

Data Source: https://registry.opendata.aws/nyc-tlc-trip-records-pds/

## Business Problem or Opportunity, Domain Knowledge

Pick-up and drop-off dates/times, pick-up and drop-off locations, trip distances, itemized rates, rate kinds, payment types, and driver-reported passenger counts are all captured in the yellow and green cab trip records. 
Technology providers authorized under the Taxicab and Livery Passenger Enhancement Programs (TPEP/LPEP) collected and supplied the data utilized in the linked datasets to the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC). The trip data was not created by TLC, and TLC provides no warranties or representations about its correctness.

The For-Hire Vehicle (“FHV”) trip records include fields capturing the dispatching base license number and the pick-up date, time, and taxi zone location ID (shape file below). These records are generated from the FHV Trip Record submissions made by bases. Note: The TLC publishes base trip record data as submitted by the bases, and we cannot guarantee or confirm their accuracy or completeness. Therefore, this may not represent the total amount of trips dispatched by all TLC-licensed bases. The TLC performs routine reviews of the records and takes enforcement actions when necessary to ensure, to the extent possible, complete and accurate information.

## Research Objectives and Questions
We plan on analysing the data thoroughly and will find any existing trends and relationships that are present in the dataset.

We will then perform predictive analysis on the dataset.
